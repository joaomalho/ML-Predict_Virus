## Data Description

The Data Description Phase aims to preliminarily understand the structure of the data, this process will allow us to get familiarized with the data and have some first impressions of patterns and relations, errors and associated changes.

The Data Description is composed by 4 steps:

### Data Collection 
- To understand the location of the data files, their format, and import them to the project.

### Data Description 
- Describing the structure of the tables imported in step 1, i.e number of rows, columns, datatypes; as well as showcasing some values

### Data Exploration 
- Exploring the data with some high-level aggregate statistical analysis, to have a preliminary understanding of patterns and start hypothesizing about how the attributes relate.

### Data Quality Verification 
- Identifying errors in data values, such as inconsistent types, duplicate rows, and missing values
